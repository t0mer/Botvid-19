## Usage

#### docker-compose from hub
```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  havid-19:
    image: techblog/botid-19
    container_name: botid-19
    restart: always
    labels:
      - "com.ouroboros.enable=true"
    environment:
      - API_KEY= #Telegram BOT API
      - ALLOWED_IDS= #Your Telegram ID (Get is using @myidbot)
   ports:
      - "6700:6700"
```

Replace API_KEY with your bot token. if you do not have existing bot you can create one
using the instruction in this article:
[Bots: An introduction for developers](https://core.telegram.org/bots) 

In order to secure the bot and block unwanted calls from Unauthorized users add your allowd Id's with comma separated values into ALLOWED_IDS
environmet. in order to get your id use @myidbot in telegram and send the /getid command. the result will be your ID:
